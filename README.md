# tenNames
Project intended for me to experiment with integrating my python.
The program pulls 10 random names/addresses out of a MongoDB database and prints them onto a web page.

# Modules 
faker, pymongo, csv, django, and socket


# Contents:
fakeData.py - Small library with two funcitons: create_data which creates a csv file, inserts a header into the first line, creates a printer 




Changelog:
8/23/21 - Stored MongoDB login credentials/functions into an object in the models file.
          Cleaned up code
