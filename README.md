# tenNames
Project intended for me to experiment with integrating my python.
The program pulls 10 random names/addresses out of a MongoDB database and prints them onto a web page.




Changelog:
8/23/21 - Stored MongoDB login credentials/functions into an object in the models file.
          Cleaned up code
